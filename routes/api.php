| API Routes

| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| is assigned the "api" middleware group. Enjoy building your API!

| No routes here
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| This file is not used. All API routes will pass through web, sessions,
| and cookies validation, for this reason we use "web.php" instead of
| "api.php".
|
| By now, there is no need for API-related stuff like tokens and Sanctum
| authentication.
